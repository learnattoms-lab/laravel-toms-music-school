# Git Workflow Memory

## Critical Workflow Rules (Keep in Memory)

### 1. Commit Strategy
- **ONE TASK = ONE COMMIT**
- Each task must have its own individual commit
- Never commit multiple tasks in a single commit
- Commit message format: `Task X.Y: Task Title`

### 2. Feature Branch Strategy
- **ONE PHASE = ONE FEATURE BRANCH**
- Feature branches follow pattern: `feature/phase-X-phase-name`
- When a phase is complete, merge feature branch to `main` with `--no-ff`
- Tag phase completion: `phase-X-complete`

### 3. Phase Completion Workflow
1. Ensure all tasks have individual commits
2. Create phase completion empty commit (optional summary)
3. Tag phase completion: `git tag -a phase-X-complete`
4. Push feature branch and tag
5. Merge to main with `--no-ff`: `git merge feature/phase-X --no-ff`
6. Push main branch

### 4. Starting New Phase
1. Create new feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/phase-X-phase-name`
2. Work on tasks one at a time
3. Commit each task individually
4. Push regularly: `git push origin feature/phase-X-phase-name`

**IMPORTANT**: Always remember:
- ✅ One task = One commit (NEVER commit multiple tasks together)
- ✅ One phase = One feature branch (NEVER mix phases in one branch)
- ✅ Merge with --no-ff when phase complete (preserves branch history)
- ✅ Tag phase completions (for milestone tracking)

**For Future Phases:**
- Start by creating feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/phase-X-phase-name`
- Complete tasks ONE AT A TIME
- Commit immediately after each task: `git commit -m "Task X.Y: Task Title"`
- Push regularly: `git push origin feature/phase-X-phase-name`
- When phase complete, merge to main and tag
